I think the most interesting topic in my domain this quarter is the connectivity between each region of the brain altoghter. 
I think I want to investigate more on what the signals can tell me anything about the activity of the body which can be read by the brain.
I think is to get more understanding and investiagtion on the brain signal and how they are correlated.
I think more on machine learning packages and analysis packages that can work with the brain data.
